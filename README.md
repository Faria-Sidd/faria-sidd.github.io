Education is a lifelong process. It never ends, and the more one studies, the more likely is for him to grow intellectually and at the same time, professionally. However, job responsibilities and family engagements generally cut short one's education journey. It is often seen that once a person gets into a particular job and field, he becomes quite complacent about his situation, not realizing that his current skills and qualifications are only going to help him reach a particular level and not beyond. In order to rise in his chosen field and industry, he must continuously supplement his skills with fresh education. The advent of internet technology has done wonders for the education industry. It has helped erase time limitations and position boundaries and made quality education available for all at the simple click of a button.

# The Benefits of an Online Education

[The Benefits of an Online Education](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi_oDH6PSXSdJ_ebvf3R8BGEWrr0NkXFuoqCSser4m0yM_h5KYioBxJ-jQrKNRznmWg3VQ66wGrXdonBrD0DuUan-2N9bluGTbta44CEeLIc-LIT2vkycguLywH9hZZAjRLI9cRrG9zN4GrWrr0PY3bp9_kxgcvQHICWyiOBBQ3GzuchQ8BeuDUJQJU=w640-h428)

Truly we live in a quick-paced, quick-acting world. The technology that we live with every day, the things that our children could not imagine life without, are things that were written about in science fiction books when we were kids. Very few things have not kept up with the changes, but one that has sadly fallen behind is educational tools. For the most part, schools today are still driven by the textbook, which takes thousands of dollars to update and costs schools significant portions of their operating costs, but they are out of date within months of printing. However, with the rising availability of online media and online data, we find the alternative to the textbook - online education.

## Benefits of an Online Education
There are many benefits to online education, but foremost among them is that information never gets old or stale. Online education allows for constantly updated, "live" subjects, and this makes online education far more flexible than the traditional school. Information can be updated at will in an online program, and current events are never more than a few mice clicks away. Studying history? Something that doesn't change? New books and supplements come out all the time, and those too are now available immediately in electronic form. There is no waiting for updates with online education.

Also, because this information is changing rapidly, but readily available, teachers in an online format can have immediate access to students or other teachers for any collaborative work. Grading can happen instantaneously, as can testing. Online education doesn't have to stop just because the clock chimes a particular hour or because someone has to leave. The student can continue to learn, investigate, and grow in knowledge and skill, at his own pace. Online education is a 24-7 school - all at the touch of a computer, which is highly portable and easily manageable by even the youngest of students.

Beyond the initial cost of a computer, online education is usually very affordable as well. Computer prices have dropped significantly and most basic computers will handle the software needs of institutional course providers. Since data is widely available in electronic form, the only additional costs tend to be for the service providers who teach, track, or document the student learner on their journey. These fees are usually far less than the plethora of costs that quickly add up when considering food, transportation, events, and supply fees related to more traditional school costs.

All in all, the benefits of online education are increasing all the time. More and more programs are offering this type of format, and many students have literally walked away from schools "in buildings" in favor of schools "through their computer." The flexibilities and possibilities make this an easy walk.

# Online Education is Very Important

[Online Education is Very Important](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhKU5y3HdHj9aaYA6TR2JceII1Y0py6xn4Frv_pSV3isQXTENgYopOvtj59GXUzK_spz4HjfG313yvWfFdhx_TL6J_BENuB8k4YkibmiSA8WjtoWsV2TXI3RMWRN5tUwDAmu-PPWjBDdpw0xPWhJli4csTROQTKChmOvapsXUB8-hrSyqVLYFpPkZyQ=w640-h426)

The impact of education on human society is immense, once a person is educated he is in the proper sense. When a man is educated, he becomes rational and it trains the human mind to make the right decisions. An uneducated person cannot read or write and that is why he is closed to all information and knowledge. It is through education that information and knowledge are received and spread around the world.


## Why itâ€™s important?
People who do not learn or study are shut off from the outside world. In contrast, an educated man lives with all his windows open towards the outside world. The quality of a nation's human resources is easily judged by the number of people that are literate and that have some form of education, living in it. If a nation wants to achieve growth, education is a must and to keep it going. This explains why most of the rich and developed nations in the world have such a high literacy rate, it is because of their educated human resources.

There are a lot of nations that offer high levels of training and education programs as well as other training programs for normal credit programs. In the world, there are millions of people that want to learn and want to be highly educated. To cater to all the needs of education of the working population, many colleges and universities offer online education. These online education programs are very helpful for working people as well as students. Working people need to keep on learning and it is not always possible to do when working all the time. Students can also learn an online degree to get more knowledge at the same time. These universities and colleges offer almost any degree there is that one could study.

In most professional careers like doctors and dentists, learning must be followed lifelong to keep them on top of everything. These people do not just have to update their skills and knowledge, but they also have to learn new techniques of practice and perfect old ones. Many of these professionals have a huge responsibility towards society, so for them, education is a must. It is in scenarios like this that distance education comes into the picture. Most people do not have the time to attend classes, so online education can be very convenient for them and from the comfort of their homes.

## End
The importance of education can simply not be overlooked by any nation, especially in the world of today where education has become even more vital. It is an absolute necessity for the economic and social development of any nation and for any individual.

[Online Education](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj5evR1yKLnHd6A8dae5ncPgSrf6d7WvwUDHtkeoG2Spq3PjEGjeRmPiN4SL3QQ_DcNJe55k3YahirOpbtck60LxMUmlBQQ_JEbcTFidGH5tsgQypkqQJsw3SNHT3M_yHSDU9Iai4dnYPkM1hkBcNkUR4B5ywhD-zug50RN6g6Vwtl9zyd5fQJpvz5L=w640-h428)

Online education is based on the Internet or other Web-based methods. With the advent of this huge revolution known as Web 2.0, online education has become the order of the day. So, in a way, online education can also be called the new wave of learning and can be termed as a part of Education 2.0. It makes use of the World Wide Web, where teachers and students exchange text, pictures, audio, and video. File sharing and communications tools like email, chats, and audio and video conferencing are integral to this mode of education. Online education has made a big splash in the web world. Within the past decade, online MBA education has provided millions of people with a new incentive to learn.


## Online Education Type
The first type of online education happened in the mid-1990s. The very first e-training companies wanted to dedicate their services to mainly businesses because they did not want to hire outside trainers. So, basically, online education originated as a cost-cutting method. Even today, this stands out as one of the major advantages of distance education. Another important benefit to distance education is the platform of working with a varied range of learners, teachers, and subject matter experts outside a student's geographic area. This exposure to people from different cultures and levels of experience is a potential benefit that can enhance the learning environment and provide learners with a wider network of contacts. Online education is also quite beneficial to learners who are shy, have difficulty in keeping pace with other students during an actual class, or need time to express themselves effectively.

The ability to set your own study time is yet another major advantage of correspondence education. One might be looking for a promotion or career change that requires additional training or one might simply be ready to learn something new. But with today's busy lifestyle, there is little time to devote to regularly scheduled class time. distance learning education, in such cases, can be a great asset for a motivated person.


### End
Therefore, we can come to the conclusion that online education plays a major role in today's life, and slowly from want it is becoming a need. That is the reason why all the major brick-and-mortar colleges in the world are slowly facilitating online courses. The new-age learning opens up many avenues which we have not explored before and offers an array of possibilities.

# Is Online Education Suitable For You?

[Is Online Education Suitable For You?](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhRCb95AYJbn0bbid_XkljOlifDrHOw3VrQlOBkNTm1RrLxeYOT2StU0FB3SCKlLaSoaxKQGA5ue-INumMB1ZS9uaMV06pAd4UXj8JyFxnrg8LhUL3xGTb_xlpOxvYBkpxbDDxdgW1pFQdxDAS0GDQw2Qk5NzyKrNJJxtu9zTCGs6hPtMeGqar5Vnq9=w640-h426)

Online education gives students not only convenience but also freedom and it comes with a lower price. Although this form of education sounds fun, not everyone prefers this mode of study. Since the situation is as such, it is best to write down the pros and cons of this education system. Then, look at your list to see which you prefer, traditional education or online education.

Most people like studying online because it is convenient. Education is about reaching out to students from every place and every age. Employees still can work and get a degree at the same time. Parents can also do the same without having to put their children in daycare but on top of all that, nothing can stop you from having a degree.

## Steps in deciding an online school

Before taking an online course, ask yourself what good it will do for you? What can you benefit from it? The first step is to choose the institution that is accredited so that it is easier for you to further your studies or get a good job opportunity. Check the school to make sure it is not a fraud as this problem has been going on for a while. Make sure that the degree you get online is a standard degree. Everything should be the same with the degree based on campus.

## The good & bad of online education

Like it is said earlier, not everyone prefers distance learning. This is because some people do better in a face-to-face learning environment. They prefer an active discussion between lecturers and students, attending workshops and seminars. That way, it is more interesting than sitting at home and facing the computer. Since that it is interesting, students absorb information better, which means that it helps with their results. Although online education is good due to the convenience, at times it is intended for a better and higher education.

Social life is important in everyone's life and when you study online, there is not much memory of social life compared to studying on campus. Most students enjoyed their campus life because they are interacting with peers and lecturers instead of facing the computer. Yes, getting educated via cyberspace is cheaper but it does not offer a lifetime experience compared to studying on campus.


### Conclusion
At the end of your degree years, you only get a degree...nothing more. Compared to students who studied on campus, they went through more life experiences and became more knowledgeable on both life and the course. Some people might regret this opportunity but then again, we are free to choose.

Write down as many advantages and disadvantages of studying online and vice versa. Make sure you do not end up regretting your choice. We only live once, make the best out of it.
